# mementol

*Memory medication for Claude Code — a daily dose so Claude doesn't forget.*

A Claude Code plugin that **automatically injects your linked memory files into every prompt** — on any project, no per-project config. (Think Cavinton for your context window.)

## The problem

Claude Code encourages a lean "index" memory file (`MEMORY.md`, or a `## Memory`
section in `CLAUDE.md`) that links out to deeper topic files:

```markdown
## Memory — read these before working
- [Product Lists](memory/product-lists.md) — sync system, fuzzy matching, pricing
- [Deployment](memory/deployment.md) — build steps, server layout, rollback
```

Claude Code loads the **index file's own text** into context — but it does **not**
reliably act on an instruction like *"read MEMORY.md and the relevant topic files."*
That instruction is just text; the model decides per-turn whether to go open those
files, and often skips it. So on a large codebase your carefully-written deep-dive
memory is quietly ignored unless you explicitly say *"read the memory files."*

(Note: `@import` lines in `CLAUDE.md` — e.g. `@memory/product-lists.md` — *do* get
pulled in automatically. A prose "please read these" does not. This plugin handles
both, and works for `MEMORY.md` indexes that aren't `CLAUDE.md` at all.)

## What this does

On **every prompt**, a `UserPromptSubmit` hook:

1. Discovers your memory **index** files (see *Where it looks* below).
2. Follows every markdown link `[t](file.md)` and `@import` reference to a `.md` file —
   **recursively** (bounded), so a `CLAUDE.md → MEMORY.md → topic.md` chain is fully resolved.
3. Injects the contents of every linked file **that actually exists** into the prompt context.

So your deep-dive memory is **always loaded**, automatically, without you asking.
In projects with no memory it outputs nothing — safe to install globally.

## Requirements

- Claude Code (recent version — uses the plugin `args` hook form).
- Node.js — already present, since Claude Code itself runs on it. No extra install.

## Install

In Claude Code, run these two commands:

```
/plugin marketplace add cc-mementol/mementol
/plugin install mementol@mementol
```

Then open `/hooks` once (or restart Claude Code) to activate it — and that's it.
It now runs on every prompt, automatically loading your linked memory on any
project that has memory files. No `settings.json` editing required.

To turn it off later, run `/plugin` and disable it (or `/plugin uninstall`).

Clone or download the repo, then point the marketplace at the folder path
instead of GitHub:

```
/plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/mementol
/plugin install mementol@mementol
```

</details>

## Where it looks

It scans these locations (all that exist are used, de-duplicated):

**Memory directories** — if the dir has a `MEMORY.md` it's used as the index; a
*trusted* dir with no index has all its `.md` files injected:

| Location | Trusted (inject all `.md` if no index) |
|---|---|
| `$MEMORY_LOADER_DIR` | yes |
| `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/` (auto-memory, via `transcript_path`) | yes |
| `<project>/.claude/memory/` | yes |
| `<project>/memory/` | no — only used if it contains `MEMORY.md` |

**Index files** — parsed for links to follow:

- `<project>/CLAUDE.md`, `<project>/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- `<project>/MEMORY.md`, `<project>/.claude/MEMORY.md`

This covers Claude Code's default auto-memory location **and** project-committed
memory, with no configuration. If your memory lives somewhere else, point
`MEMORY_LOADER_DIR` at the folder that contains your `MEMORY.md`.

## What gets injected

- All `.md` files reachable from an index via markdown links or `@import`, that exist on disk.
- Relative paths resolve against the **index file's own directory**.
- External links (`https://…`) are ignored.
- `CLAUDE.md` files are parsed for links but **never re-injected** — Claude Code
  already loads them. `MEMORY.md` and topic files *are* injected. (If your `MEMORY.md`
  is in Claude Code's auto-memory, it's already in context, so it may appear once
  more here. Harmless.)
- Recursion is bounded (default depth 4) and de-duplicated, so cycles are safe.

## Dry run — see what it would load

Run it from a project root with `--list`:

```bash
node /path/to/mementol/scripts/inject-memory.mjs --list
```

It prints the files it would inject and their sizes (or "no memory files found").
Great for verifying a project before trusting the hook. (Without a piped hook
payload it uses the current working directory.)

## Configuration

**Set it from the UI — no file editing.** When you enable the plugin, Claude Code prompts you for two options — **Injection mode** (`always`/`session`/`relevant`) and **Max injected bytes** — each with a sensible default you can just accept. Change them anytime via `/plugin` → **mementol** → its configuration.

Everything below is optional — for people who prefer config files or want the other knobs:

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MEMORY_LOADER_MODE` | `always` | When/what to inject — `always`, `session`, or `relevant`. See **Modes** below. |
| `MEMORY_LOADER_DIR` | *(auto-detected)* | Explicit path to the folder containing your `MEMORY.md`. |
| `MEMORY_LOADER_MAX_BYTES` | `200000` | Cap on total injected bytes. On overflow, remaining files are skipped with a note. |
| `MEMORY_LOADER_MAX_DEPTH` | `4` | How many link-hops to follow from an index file. |

Set these in your Claude Code `settings.json` under `"env"`, or in your shell environment. For example:

```json
{ "env": { "MEMORY_LOADER_MODE": "relevant" } }
```

### Modes

`MEMORY_LOADER_MODE` lets each user pick their own cost/reliability balance:

| Mode | What it does | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| `always` *(default)* | Inject **all** memory on **every** prompt. | Most reliable — survives Claude Code's context compaction, so memory is never "forgotten." Highest token cost; compounds over a long chat. |
| `session` | Inject all memory **once per session** (at `SessionStart`), like `CLAUDE.md`. | Cheapest. But a long session's auto-compaction can summarize it away — the same forgetting you're fighting. |
| `relevant` | Every prompt, but inject only the topic files whose keywords match the prompt (the lean `MEMORY.md` index is always kept). | Cheap on trivial prompts, full depth when relevant. It's a keyword heuristic, so it can miss a file whose wording doesn't match. |

Rule of thumb: `always` if you don't care about tokens and want it bulletproof; `relevant` if you want effectiveness without paying for everything on every "ok"; `session` if you want it cheapest and your sessions aren't marathon-length.

### Helping `relevant` mode match (synonyms)

`relevant` matches your prompt against each file's text, so a file is missed when the prompt uses a word the file doesn't contain ("automobile" vs "car"). Both fixes stay local — no external service:

- **Add a `keywords:` line** to a memory file's frontmatter with synonyms, abbreviations, and alternate terms. mementol matches the whole file (frontmatter included), so those terms make it surface:
  ```yaml
  ---
  name: Product pricing
  keywords: [pricing, price, cost, margin, markup, supplier, vendor, SKU, cikkszám]
  ---
  ```
- **Let Claude write them.** Run **`/mementol-keywords`** and Claude reads your memory files and adds a synonym-rich `keywords:` line to each. To make it automatic for *new* memory, add one line to your `CLAUDE.md` / memory guidance:
  > When writing a memory file, include a `keywords:` frontmatter array of synonyms, abbreviations, and alternate terms for the topic.

(mementol also does light word-form matching — `pricing` finds `price` on its own — so it's mainly true synonyms you need to write down.)

## A note on token cost

In the default `always` mode, mementol injects your linked memory on **every** prompt,
including trivial ones — bulletproof, but it adds tokens each turn and compounds over a
long conversation. If that matters to you, switch `MEMORY_LOADER_MODE` to `relevant` or
`session` (see **Modes** above), keep topic files focused, and use `--list` to check your
real footprint.

## How to disable

Run `/plugin`, select `mementol`, and disable it — or `/plugin uninstall`.

## Why "mementol"?

Half *Memento* (the film about a man who can't form new memories, so he tattoos
notes to himself), half over-the-counter brain pill. That's the whole job:
external notes so Claude doesn't forget.
